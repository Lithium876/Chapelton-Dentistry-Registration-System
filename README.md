# Chapelton Dentistry Registration System

The dental facility at Chapelton Hospital, which is located in Chapelton, Clarendon Jamaica serves a large population of people from the surrounding communities. There is only one dentist and two dental nurses who serve the patients. The facility is experiencing inefficient patient file organization. This is a major problem that affects both the patient and dental facility workers. 

The workers complain about working too long and hard.  Registering new patient is tedious as registering returning patients.  The process involves searching through old, dusty file jackets to see if patients were previously registered.  Some patients name appears several times.  Patients often times get very disgruntled with the poor services offered.  The administrators of the facility find this problem unacceptable and has therefore engage the researcher to conduct an investigation to find the source of the problem.
